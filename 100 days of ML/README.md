# 100 days of ML!

Its a repository to keep track of my progress of 100 days of ML
as suggested by [in this repository](https://github.com/cybot1711/Learn_Machine_Learning_in_3_Months)

### Day 1 - (16-May -2022)

Today I began with the linear algebra starting off with the playlist by [3 blue one brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
. Along with [Mutivariable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-02-multivariable-calculus-fall-2007/video_galleries/video-lectures/) which is a prerequisite for [Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/pages/syllabus/).

The notes of what i studied are as follows:-

### Day 2 -(17-May-2022)

Today i completed the linear algebra via the playlist of 3 blue one brown
along with it.

To improve my R skills i began [Data science With R](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+PH125.1x+1T2022/home)

Here is my assignment for [Data science with R](https://github.com/pratham-saraf/Data-science-portfolio/tree/main/100%20days%20of%20ML/Day-2/)

completed notes of the playlist [Essence of linear algebra](https://dynalist.io/d/QGH-mc0kByi7OH3Cub6tHxlv#collapse&inline-images&theme=default)
